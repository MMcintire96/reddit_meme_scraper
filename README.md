#Reddit meme Scraper

creds need to be in connect.py file

call python get_data.py and you can change the self status to either self label or have the model label

in get_data - preds='self' makes it so you can start building a db of memes - i suggest removing my db
then in keras_train.py set new_data=True

I cant upload my own .npy files or .h5 files as they are rather large
the model is not trained well right now and needs to be trained further
